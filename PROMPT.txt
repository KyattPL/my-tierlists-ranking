Yo I have this app using NextJS, tailwind and shadcn (maybe other libs). This app is used to host my tierlists / rankings for my viewers or friends. I'd like to rank random things like "souls games" or "LoL Worlds songs" or "songs from a specific album of a specific metal band". That means some tierlists might be contained within others (for example rankings of albums AND rankings of songs within those albums). So the solution allows to browse this lists in a kind of tree-like or file-directory matter. Also the structure of this lists varies a lot (For example movies might have atmosphere/tempo/acting/feelings but souls games boss fights / locations / items etc.)
